  This demonstrates performing docker login with a credentials store
  configured, and then building an image with a Dockerfile in the root of
  your repository, naming the image to be the same name as your repository,
  and then pushing to the default docker registry (at docker.io)

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    docker: circleci/docker@x.y.z

  workflows:
    build-and-publish-docker-image:
      jobs:
        - docker/publish:
            image:  $CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME
            use-docker-credentials-store: true
